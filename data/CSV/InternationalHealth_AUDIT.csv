JH-IIRU hopes to help reduce road traffic injuries in low-and middle-income countries by providing monitoring and evaluation support to road safety risk factors such as helmet use, speed, drink driving and seatbelt use for projects, including the Bloomberg Initiative for Global Road Safety (BIGRS) project . Dr. Hoe, who is interested in the politics of health policy, is now looking into the issue of drink driving by studying how the alcohol industry impacts policy for road safety, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). While consumption per capita is greater in high-income countries, the mortality burden is greater in low-income countries. The alcohol market potential has driven the industry to LMICs where trade liberalization has increased. Citizens in LMICs are also growing more receptive to the lures of the industry due to increasing disposable income and a larger youth population. The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Status Report on Road Safety found that the percentage of drivers testing above the legal limit varies and also differs widely across the board, however high-income countries were more likely than LMICs to have drink driving legislation in line with best practices. Today, the alcohol industry functions much like the tobacco industry of 50 years ago. By targeting consumers in LMICs, the industry hopes that their marketing efforts will have a wider reach and not as much oversight. One of the major reasons for the lack of effective drink driving policies in LMICs is the alcohol industry‚Äôs opposition to meaningful regulation around the issues of drink driving and road safety. However, it‚Äôs not just LMICs that have cause to be concerned ‚Äì in June 2016, Formula One (F1), the premier form of auto-racing, signed a deal with Heineken that allowed them to become a sponsor at sporting events. This partnership means that Heineken gets to create a larger exposure to alcohol in an already more susceptible audience. Health Systems and JH-IIRU faculty hope to influence the aggressive tactics taken by the alcohol industry by providing evidence on the negative outcomes of alcohol marketing, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes, are often a focal point when educating those in non-conflict settings about the importance of diet and physical activity; however they don‚Äôt occupy much real estate in the humanitarian sector when it comes to funding and support. Dr. Shannon Doocy, from the Health Systems Program‚Äôs is attempting to target NCDs and other health burdens with a new mobile health (m-Health) app in order to make strides in the field of humanitarian relief for Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Her work in Lebanon centers on developing an app to improve management of hypertension and diabetes in refugee patients from Syria, as well as Lebanese host community members. Addressing chronic conditions is new for humanitarian agencies - money is already stretched very thin in other immediate-need areas; however, this doesn‚Äôt mean that there won‚Äôt be dire consequences for failing to take into account the impact of untreated chronic conditions. ‚ÄúTreatment for chronic conditions like hypertension and type II diabetes requires continuous monitoring over time and uninterrupted adherence to treatment regiments, both of which are challenging in ideal settings, but exponentially more difficult in situations of displacement,‚Äù states Emily Lyles, a Research Assistant and PhD candidate collecting data on-site in Lebanon. Dr. Doocy hopes to mitigate the additional burden that chronic conditions might bring by improving the quality of care refugees receive and the information provided to them about their chronic conditions. The application itself, launched in collaboration with a developer from MIT, creates a print-out for patients on the status of their health care. Since refugees are constantly in transition, the print-out allows them to improve the continuity of their care while traveling or being herded from place to place. The app aims to benefit both patients, who upon receiving the print-out perceive the quality of care they are getting to be higher, and local health care providers in Lebanon who are now prompted to ask the patients about their lifestyle choices and other related health matters, thus collecting a whole spectrum of information. The suite of information makes it possible for clinicians to view patient history over time, an important factor for NCD management - especially amongst displaced patients who may be constantly on the move. The project is not without its challenges: the Lebanese government is currently developing NCD guidelines causing approvals to take longer than anticipated and local medical providers are seeing their caseload increase during an already stressful time period, leaving little extra time during patient consultations. Together with partner organization, International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Center for Humanitarian Health is striving to address the lack of access to and high cost of health care for many refugees who at this time, need care in every form, including against the burden of chronic conditions. The consortium hopes this study will have a sustainable impact on the introduction of m-Health care for chronic conditions in the field of humanitarian relief and provide a seamless transition for mobile populations such as refugees.¬†",3398,19554,"bloomberg school of public health, school of public health, johns hopkins, departments, academics, research, centers, admissions, preparedness, infectious diseases,Johns Hopkins University,Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,academic departments,Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Health Policy and Management,Biostatistics,International Health,Environmental Health Sciences,Mental Health,Epidemiology,Molecular Microbiology and Immunology,Health, Behavior & Society,Population,Family and Reproductive Health,Population and family health sciences, International health, global health, phd, doctorate, masters, master's, mhs, mph, global health academic programs, international health, Academic Programs, Department of International Health, GDEC, SBI, Health Systems, Human Nutrition, Social and Behavioral Interventions, Global Disease Epidemiology and Control, global health degree, global health PHD, global health master's, chronic conditions,displaced,humanitarian aid,mhealth,refugees",1001,Health Systems Program,22,,0,,0,,0,,,,41420,1044,17.361681,10,9,0.77,150,136,23,21,478e0e3fe961682603f922cc31a48f8f,0.687,,,,https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/international-health/program-areas/health-systems/Health-Systems-Program/chronic-conditions-in-times-of-crisis-using-m-health-to-help-refugees-in-transition

Within the Program, Dr. Creanga serves as an Associate Director for the International Center for Maternal and Newborn Health and co-Coordinator of the Master of Science in Public Health (MSPH) degree program in Health Systems. ¬† Dr. Creanga obtained her M.D. degree from Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Bucharest, Romania in 2002, and her Ph.D. in Population and Reproductive Health from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in 2009. She has dedicated her career to improving maternal and newborn health. As doctoral student and Research Assistant for the Bill and Melinda Gates Institute for Population and Reproductive Health, she worked on a wide range of topics including family planning, maternity care and obstetric fistula, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Immediately after graduating from Hopkins, Dr. Creanga began working for the Division of Reproductive Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), first as an Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer and then as Medical Epidemiologist and Senior Scientist over a period of six years. While at the CDC, Dr. Creanga was instrumental in leading epidemiologic investigations in maternal and infant health and serving as a subject matter expert on maternal mortality, severe maternal morbidity, and perinatal illicit drug abuse. Notably, Dr. Creanga led the United States Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System, and it was for this work that she received the 2013 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, the highest honor bestowed by the¬†United States¬†government on outstanding scientists and engineers in the early stages of their independent research careers. In her current academic position, Dr. Creanga is developing a research agenda around the quality of obstetric care, both domestically and internationally, and has active projects in India and the United States. In India, she works with CARE on a project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to evaluate various initiatives to improve maternal and newborn health care in the state of Bihar. ¬†In the United States, Dr. Creanga has developed several projects examining severe maternal morbidity, aiming to reduce its burden by integrating clinical decision-making tools into electronic medical records at Johns Hopkins Medicine.

Rao, assistant professor, joined the Health Systems Program in 2014, bringing expertise in health systems and health economics. He received his master‚Äôs degree at Cornell University in agriculture and resource economics and his PhD in health systems from the Program. Prior to joining the Health Systems Program, Dr. Rao worked with the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), where he conducted research on health systems and taught health economics. Before coming to PHFI, Dr. Rao worked in Afghanistan as part of the Johns Hopkins team supporting their Ministry of Public Health (MoH) to evaluate models of community financing of health services. Dr. Rao started his career in public health at the World Bank, working on the delivery of child nutrition and health services in India. In 2016, Dr. Rao was selected as a practitioner resident fellow to the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center Residency Program. Dr. Rao‚Äôs research focuses on three major areas ‚Äì human resources for health, health financing and evaluation. He is particularly concerned with issues around¬†strengthening primary care and nutrition services, measuring quality of care, and reducing financial hardship faced by households due to health care payments. He teaches courses in health financing in low- and middle-income countries, and the role of health in economic development. Dr. Rao also co-leads the Program‚Äôs health systems seminars. Dr. Rao is involved with a variety of research projects. One of Dr. Rao‚Äôs key projects includes evaluation of a large-scale mentoring program for nurses at primary health centers in the state of Bihar, India. The mentoring program is funded by the Gates Foundation and provides nurses with the knowledge and skills to improve their obstetric skills. This evaluation is being conducted in partnership with the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing. Dr. Rao is also currently working on designing a conditional cash-transfer program for improving nutrition in young children in India. The study uses a discrete choice experiment to understand the preferences of mothers for program conditionalities and cash transfer amounts. Other key projects include mentoring researchers from eight different countries to help them improve their research skills,¬†conducting a cost-effectiveness analysis of a nutrition program in Malawi,¬†and a previous health financing project in Kyrgyzstan that examined how health financing issues affect delivery of services. Going forward, Dr. Rao is interested in studying conditional and unconditional cash transfer programs, aging and what implications that has for health systems and the financing of health care, and how the management and institutional structures of health services affect health worker performance and quality of care.

In that time, he has taught implementation research and practice, and has focused his work on approaches to strengthening health systems, injury epidemiology, and evaluating the impact of child injury interventions. Prior to coming to Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH), Kunle attended medical school at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria. He served as the district health manager and medical director under the Ministry of Health in Bayelsa State in south Nigeria for four years, where he coordinated and oversaw the delivery of primary health care services. When Kunle originally came to JHSPH to get his master‚Äôs, he focused on epidemiology and biostatistics. His priority was to get a thorough understanding on how to best do public health research. Upon getting his master‚Äôs, he served as county health manager and medical coordinator in Liberia, and later returned to working with JHSPH, joining the Hopkins team in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, he assessed the performance of the health system and provided monitoring and evaluation services for technical assistance in strengthening health activities and research. Kunle came back to the United States to get his PhD degree in the Department of International Health at JHSPH. In addition to serving as assistant scientist for the Health Systems Program, he also joined the Johns Hopkins International Injury Research Unit (JH-IIRU), housed within the Program. He managed JH-IIRU‚Äôs program in Bangladesh on child drowning and worked on measuring and quantifying the burden of childhood injuries and likely interventions. Currently, Kunle works mainly in three areas within the Health Systems Program: conducting research on implementation science, health systems strengthening strategies, and child injuries; teaching courses on implementation research and practices, health systems in low- and middle-income countries, and child injuries (confronting the burden of injuries, summary measures of population health); and providing mentorship and service for students in the Program by advising master‚Äôs students and serving as co-coordinator for the Master of Science in Public Health (MSPH) program. Kunle is also co-director of the school-wide DrPH concentration in health equity and social justice, and serves as the section editor for the health systems section of the Journal of Health, Population and Nutrition. Kunle hopes to continue to develop his skills in implementation science and evaluating complex interventions. His primary focus is on studying how to implement and evaluate health systems strengthening and child injuries interventions. He also aims to continue studying issues around access to health care, health equity and improving child health. Going forward he wants to continue making a difference in people‚Äôs lives by developing a body of work in implementation science, a body of work in systems science, and a body of work in child injuries.

The five-day conference centered on resiliency, specifically resilient and responsive health systems for a changing world. Other sub-themes were gender and ethics, innovation in health systems research, and power and politics in promoting public health values. The Health Systems Program of the Department of International Health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health participated in a total of 30 sessions, including plenary, organized, oral, skills-building, satellite, poster and e-poster sessions. Thirteen faculty and nine students were in attendance at the conference, representing both the Department of International Health and the Health Systems Program. World Diabetes Day on November 14 launched the Global Symposium and Health Systems Program Director, Dr. Adnan Hyder, was featured in a Devex article, Health systems research is critical to tackle the global burden ¬†of disease. In the article, Dr. Hyder (who is also a HSG Board member), discussed using evidence-based and innovative health systems research to address the growing burden of diabetes in resource-poor settings and vulnerable communities. Other key highlights from the Health Systems Program‚Äôs coverage at the Symposium included the official opening welcome address given by Dr. Sara Bennett, several panel sessions on ethics in health systems research featuring Drs. Pratt and Hyder, an interactive session on gender analysis in health systems research led by Dr. Rosemary Morgan, and a discussion led by Dr. Daniela Rodriguez on negotiating power and politics during programmatic transition in middle-income countries. One of Health Systems‚Äô top tweets was on gender equality, a growing theme at this year‚Äôs event. This year had an increased focus on including more diverse voices, with more attention on gender analysis and intersectionality, research from Latin America, and input from indigenous populations. An important takeaway was that health systems research needs to do more to incorporate different perspectives into campaigns, programs, education and research. Marginalized populations with their own subset of health inequalities cannot be neglected going forward. The Health Systems Program looks forward to addressing issues of inequality in health systems research and advocating for more vulnerable populations worldwide as we begin preparing for the fifth global symposium that will be taking place in Liverpool in 2018.¬†",2546,14984,"bloomberg school of public health, school of public health, johns hopkins, departments, academics, research, centers, admissions, preparedness, infectious diseases,Johns Hopkins University,Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,academic departments,Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Health Policy and Management,Biostatistics,International Health,Environmental Health Sciences,Mental Health,Epidemiology,Molecular Microbiology and Immunology,Health, Behavior & Society,Population,Family and Reproductive Health,Population and family health sciences, International health, global health, phd, doctorate, masters, master's, mhs, mph, global health academic programs, international health, Academic Programs, Department of International Health, GDEC, SBI, Health Systems, Human Nutrition, Social and Behavioral Interventions, Global Disease Epidemiology and Control, global health degree, global health PHD, global health master's",937,Health Systems Program,22,,0,,0,,0,,,,39890,887,15.669994,5,4,0.34,146,132,25,23,f54397e670231097496a6cdde48c8104,0.558,,,,https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/international-health/program-areas/health-systems/Health-Systems-Program/fourth-global-symposium-on-health-systems-research-thoughts-and-takeaways

Instead of being an add-on, gender analysis in health systems research should be an integral component at every phase. Health systems are not gender neutral; if the goal is to create equitable and sustainable health solutions and health promotion interventions, then gender (and how gender interacts with other social stratifiers) needs to be considered when designing effective solutions. Applying a gender lens means examining the role of gender within the different building blocks of health systems and how we can most effectively shape health systems policies, programs and services to benefit everyone. This includes studying how gender power relations play out within a health system and ensuring that we do not perpetuate different gender inequities in our research. Dr. Rosemary Morgan , assistant scientist in the Health Systems Program of the Department of International Health, brings her experience working on the project, ‚Äú Research in Gender and Ethics (RinGs): Building Stronger Health Systems ‚Äù to the Program. The project, funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID), seeks to galvanize gender analysis within health systems research by providing resources for and building the capacity of health systems research to conduct gender analysis. In addition, Dr. Morgan has been working with students within the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH) to explore the role of gender within different areas of the health system. Dr. Morgan advised Poonam Daryani , a recent graduate of the MPH program at JHSPH, to conduct an intersectional gender analysis of the Zika response in Brazil. Through her analysis, Poonam explored how the distribution of power based on gender interacted with other social stratifiers, such as race and class, to create different vulnerabilities to Zika infection during the epidemic. Findings showed that the national response, with its focus on household-level vector control efforts, did not consider the complex sociocultural and economic barriers facing women in Brazil. Failure to account for differential power relations and the resulting gender inequities in Brazil may have limited the effectiveness of the national response in curbing transmission of the virus. Moreover, the inadequacies of the national response were felt largest by poor black and brown Brazilian women, who are largely concentrated in the peripheries of urban centers as well as the North and Northeast regions of the country and who experience disproportionate and compounding barriers to achieving positive health outcomes. The gender analysis inspired Poonam to pursue the highly competitive Johns Hopkins-Pulitzer Center Fellowship for Global Health Reporting, through which Poonam traveled to the northeast of Brazil to explore the long-term consequences of Zika on those who care for and raise children with congenital Zika syndrome. Health responses can be strengthened with a greater awareness of gender relations in a given society‚Äôs health system. Ideal responses examine and question gender inequities in order to achieve health goals and advance gender justice. It is necessary to apply a gender lens to all health issues so that we can build policies, structures and procedures at an institutional level that create¬†a healthy society for everyone.¬†",3578,20729,"bloomberg school of public health, school of public health, johns hopkins, departments, academics, research, centers, admissions, preparedness, infectious diseases,Johns Hopkins University,Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,academic departments,Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Health Policy and Management,Biostatistics,International Health,Environmental Health Sciences,Mental Health,Epidemiology,Molecular Microbiology and Immunology,Health, Behavior & Society,Population,Family and Reproductive Health,Population and family health sciences, International health, global health, phd, doctorate, masters, master's, mhs, mph, global health academic programs, international health, Academic Programs, Department of International Health, GDEC, SBI, Health Systems, Human Nutrition, Social and Behavioral Interventions, Global Disease Epidemiology and Control, global health degree, global health PHD, global health master's, brazil,gender analysis,gender power relations,health systems,health systems and policy research,zika",1039,Health Systems Program,22,,0,,0,,0,,,,42808,1072,17.308592,17,12,1.03,153,138,24,22,5e75fae54794a94f40d41b7f98b9eb10,0.649,,,,https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/international-health/program-areas/health-systems/Health-Systems-Program/gender-analysis-and-health-systems-research-the-importance-of-applying-a-gender-lens

In order to honor the day, JHU is hosting two featured speakers: Ambassador Deborah Birx, U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator & U.S. Special Representative for Global Health Diplomacy and Olusoji Adeyi, Director of Global Practice for Health, Nutrition, and Population at the World Bank. In a current political climate where attitudes towards public health are growing increasingly negative, it is important to celebrate past successes and reflect on what can be done to shape future health responses. In the face of looming health threats such as an increase in refugees, the opioid epidemic, climate change, and a growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), it is especially important to stress the positive impact public health has had worldwide. Ambassador Deborah Birx is an acclaimed leader in the field of HIV/AIDS, with three decades of experience focusing on HIV/AIDS immunology, vaccine research and global health. She will provide her insight from years of experience ending preventable child and maternal deaths, working towards an aids-free generation, and responding to the burden of infectious disease threats.

Dr. Rao‚Äôs discussion with Barbara touched upon health equity and humility, and how to exemplify these traits in a leadership capacity. The Health Systems Program delved further into the idea of health equity as a key ingredient of effective health systems leadership by asking Dr. Rao a few questions. 1. Identifying leaders and change agents: as a teacher, how do you identify leaders and potential change agents? What are some more important qualities in a leader when it comes to promoting health equity? In some students leadership qualities are apparent ‚Äì they take charge of things naturally, don‚Äôt shy from expressing opinions and take ownership of any job given to them. There are other students who demonstrate their leadership in a quiet way ‚Äì they are more watchful and reserved but are clear about what they think and how to get the job done. In both cases, I think they like taking ownership and putting in more effort than normally expected. 2. You have a lot of experience in working in human resources for health ‚Äì what are some lessons you have learned about how leaders can effect change at the systems level? Health systems are hard to change. Yet, I think, a health system is ultimately as good as the people who make it function. Particularly because all health services are ultimately delivered by people. You can take a well-designed system but incompetent people can make it ineffectual. On the other hand, there are numerous examples of individuals who have done remarkable things working in broken health systems. I have come across so many health workers ‚Äì doctors, nurses, community workers, managers ‚Äì who for little money and working with poor infrastructure, manage to do so much so that others can benefit from their services. So I think investing in health workers and keeping them enthusiastic about their work is as critical as the particular way a health system is organized.¬† 3. For researchers such as yourself, you mentioned that you can write as many papers as you want but nothing might really happen unless there are people who can see the importance of what you do ‚Äì how can researchers position themselves as change agents and make sure their work is more likely to be implemented in the field? There is an important line between being an academic and being an activist. Researchers have traditionally seen themselves as producers of knowledge, while ‚Äòchanging the world‚Äô has been in the domain of social and political activists. More recently, you see researchers also becoming activists. In some cases it‚Äôs because the science itself is being disputed by the politically powerful like in the case of climate change. So I think there is an increasing sense that researchers should not be passive about their research and expect that it will find a voice on its own. They need to actively make it known and promote it via social media, public debates, and even demonstrations.¬† For more information on Dr. Rao‚Äôs research interests and profile, read his interview with Barbara Bush , as well as his faculty feature .¬†",3399,19812,"bloomberg school of public health, school of public health, johns hopkins, departments, academics, research, centers, admissions, preparedness, infectious diseases,Johns Hopkins University,Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,academic departments,Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Health Policy and Management,Biostatistics,International Health,Environmental Health Sciences,Mental Health,Epidemiology,Molecular Microbiology and Immunology,Health, Behavior & Society,Population,Family and Reproductive Health,Population and family health sciences, International health, global health, phd, doctorate, masters, master's, mhs, mph, global health academic programs, international health, Academic Programs, Department of International Health, GDEC, SBI, Health Systems, Human Nutrition, Social and Behavioral Interventions, Global Disease Epidemiology and Control, global health degree, global health PHD, global health master's",937,Health Systems Program,22,,0,,0,,0,,,,40568,1073,17.496914,14,9,0.77,145,132,25,23,1d71796d7eb9161b45b5454ed2c1788d,0.64,,,,https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/international-health/program-areas/health-systems/Health-Systems-Program/health-systems-leadership-promoting-health-equity-and-effecting-change

Veena‚Äôs noteworthy research, which earned her a prized place on the Emerging Voices for Global Health (EV4GH) training program, examines the power dynamics in play in the specialization of medical services in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), using emergency medicine (EM) in India as a case study. Sriram‚Äôs work centers on the dual concepts of equitable access to health care and how medical specialties are regulated in India. Developed in response to a lack of emphasis in health systems research on governance and regulation, her study examines how new medical specialties emerge in India, and how regulatory institutions within a country decide whether to include a specialty or not. She also wants to interrogate the idea of ‚Äòspecialization‚Äô as a solution to service delivery problems, such as weak emergency care, and understand how stakeholders perceive the impact of specialization on health systems and equitable access to care. Sriram is using the evolution of Emergency Medicine, a specialty formally approved by the Medical Council of India in 2009, to explore these questions. In addition to understanding how medical specialties develop, Sriram will also explore how power dynamics have shaped processes and decision making in this case. The role of power is not well understood in health systems research, and she hopes that this can contribute to the knowledge gap around this topic. Sriram, who conducted her research based out of New Delhi and Chennai in Southern India, states that her findings are still a work in progress but so far has been a great opportunity to do research on medical specialization and the regulation of postgraduate medical education - two topics that have not been the subject of much research in low- and middle-income countries such as India. Veena has been specializing in governance and human resources for health through the Health Systems Program after studying emergency care with the Program‚Äôs International Injury Research Unit (IIRU) in the summer of 2013. Sriram conducted case studies of three prehospital care organizations ¬†in Bengaluru, Karachi and Lahore, which opened the door for her to study emergency care in South Asia. She defended her proposal in the summer of 2014, receiving the Health Systems Program award, as well as a fellowship from the American Institute of Indian Studies. She launched her study in 2015 and analyzed the data in 2016; she hopes to be wrapped up in February 2017.¬†",2669,15719,"bloomberg school of public health, school of public health, johns hopkins, departments, academics, research, centers, admissions, preparedness, infectious diseases,Johns Hopkins University,Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,academic departments,Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Health Policy and Management,Biostatistics,International Health,Environmental Health Sciences,Mental Health,Epidemiology,Molecular Microbiology and Immunology,Health, Behavior & Society,Population,Family and Reproductive Health,Population and family health sciences, International health, global health, phd, doctorate, masters, master's, mhs, mph, global health academic programs, international health, Academic Programs, Department of International Health, GDEC, SBI, Health Systems, Human Nutrition, Social and Behavioral Interventions, Global Disease Epidemiology and Control, global health degree, global health PHD, global health master's, emergency medicine,health care,india,medical specialization",998,Health Systems Program,22,,0,,0,,0,,,,40442,949,15.972875,10,9,0.77,150,137,24,22,33b2278c05c3f9b015f3fab117db304c,0.67,,,,https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/international-health/program-areas/health-systems/Health-Systems-Program/health-systems-student-selected-to-emerging-voices-for-global-health-training-program

Currently, one of the most pressing issues related to female health is the high rate of maternal and perinatal deaths, many of which are preventable. The International Center for Maternal and Newborn Health (ICMNH) at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH) aims to address the burden of these preventable deaths by enhancing the knowledge base to understand the major causes of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, and developing evidenced-based public health interventions against them in different communities around the world. ICMNH is hosted by the Health Systems Program in the Department of International Health. In partnership with many local and international stakeholders and collaborators, ICMNH develops and evaluates inexpensive community-based approaches that save millions of mothers and babies. The Center conducts research in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia and relies on a strong local workforce in these regions in order to provide cost-effective methods of reducing maternal and newborn deaths. ICMNH has a large field site in Bangladesh that was established in 2001 as a partnership between Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the Bangladesh Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and several Bangladeshi NGOs. The Projahnmo Field Site has a complete census and on-going surveillance of a population size of 750,000, which allows them to have the capacity and infrastructure to do large, community-based studies. The field site capacities include a state-of-the-art laboratory managed by Dr. Samir Saha and his team at the Child Health Research Foundation (CHFR), a high-quality data center managed by Johns Hopkins ‚Äì Bangladesh, and a multidisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in epidemiology, pediatrics, neonatology, obstetrics, pneumology, and vaccine development. The field site is focused in the Sylhet region in particular, which has the highest rates of newborn and infant mortality in all of Bangladesh. The work of the Center has been instrumental in helping to develop national and global guidelines for improving maternal and newborn health. The World Health Organization (WHO), along with the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), recently released a joint statement on guidelines for managing possible severe infections in infants, based largely off of the Center‚Äôs work. The Center is part of a WHO-led, multi-country project called the Alliance for Maternal and Newborn Health Improvement (AMANHI) study, which has led to an impressive bio-specimen repository of 2,600 women that includes placental samples, ¬†saliva swabs, and other samples. The Center is developing partnerships with other universities and centers in order to detect biological and genetic markers of adverse pregnancy outcomes. This will enable better prediction of healthy or unhealthy outcomes for both mothers and babies in the future. ¬† As communities move closer to gender equality in all aspects of society, the burden that existing health disparities place on women must be addressed. Cost-effective methods of significantly reducing preventable maternal, newborn and child health are known, and it is critical to prioritize the implementation of these efforts. It is especially important to make sure that the methods are sustainable, based off of sound evidence, and community-based.

ShareAmerica highlighted the Johns Hopkins-Afghanistan-Pakistan Collaborative Trauma and Injury Research Training (JHU-AfPak-ICTIRT) program, funded by Fogarty International Center , National Institutes of Health (NIH). JH-IIRU has been in Pakistan for over a decade , dedicated to improving trauma care and emergency medical services in the area through rigorous training. Partnering with Aga Khan University (AKU), JH-IIRU worked with their Department of Emergency Medicine, established by current JH-IIRU senior technical advisor and professor of emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and former collaborator Dr. Junaid Razzak . In the second round of training, JH-IIRU incorporated Khyber Medical University ¬†with the goal of promoting trauma and injury research by training a core group of faculty between the two universities. ‚Äú The grant has been helpful in not only developing individuals and providing opportunities for their growth, but more importantly, it has helped institutional growth at various levels. Directly, the grant led to the development of the first academic department in the field of emergency medicine in the country. The department played the role of the World Health Organization‚Äôs Collaborating Center on Emergency Care. It also provided support to the prehospital emergency care system in the city of Karachi, which in turn impacted hundreds of thousands of patients a year. These larger system changing impacts are critical to population health ,‚Äù states Dr. Razzak. The program represents the first doctoral training program on injury research at AKU; by helping AKU to take this next step from masters to doctoral training, JH-IIRU is helping to build capacity in a region with a high burden of death and disability from injuries. The JHU-AfPak-ICTIRT program aims to do the same in Afghanistan, a country where many live in conflict-affected areas and injury rates are high. The training program provides an alternative to having to fly all the way to high-income countries such as the United States for education, an expensive and often inaccessible trip for many, and also combats the brain drain in the area. JH-IIRU hopes that research from Pakistan will influence the neighboring region in Afghanistan, and also address the issue of intentional and unintentional violence in the area. The research is driven by individual trainees, who are examining issues such as domestic violence, child injuries and road traffic injuries. One particular mega project currently being conducted is studying the burden of acute injuries and emergency medical care by examining emergency rooms and collecting data from over 3,000 people. ‚Äú The burden of injury and trauma in both Pakistan and Afghanistan is considerable and keeps on growing. There is a dire need to have both masters and doctoral training with concentrations in injury and trauma. The program we are offering through the Afghanistan-Pakistan International Collaborative trauma and injury research training will help elaborate further the need and sources of data on injuries in developing countries ,‚Äù states Dr. Nadeem Ullah Khan, JH-IIRU collaborator and associate professor and consultant of emergency medicine at AKU, on the importance of the JHU-AfPak-ICTIRT program. The programs in Pakistan and Afghanistan reflect a need for prioritizing injuries as a public health burden worldwide, an issue that has been neglected far too often on the global agenda. JH-IIRU‚Äôs work culminates in a desire to ensure that injury and trauma are recognized as a health policy issue in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as globally.

The special theme issue features the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH)‚Äôs work for Bloomberg Philanthropies Data for Health Initiative (D4H). Researchers at JHSPH are working to assess, harness and roll out the use of mobile phone technology in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) as a cost-effective method for the rapid collection of quality non-communicable disease (NCD) risk factor data, such as tobacco and alcohol use, physical inactivity and unhealthy diets. The special issue features JHPSH‚Äôs work in closing critical gaps in understanding the ways by which mobile phone surveys (MPS) could be used as a digital health tool in the collection of NCD data in LMICs. The issue addresses current knowledge gaps through an examination of relevant extant literature, provides an analysis of several ethical issues surrounding the use of mobile phones to collect personal data in LMICs, and examines the challenges of turning data into international- and national-level policies. The issue also offers a comparison of each primary MPS method and examines the current landscape of MPS technology currently being used for population-level data collection in LMICs. Researchers from the Health Systems Program in the Department of International Health at JHSPH were key contributors to the issue, including Drs. Adnan Hyder, Alain Labrique, Dustin Gibson and George Pariyo. They hope that this research will help to provide guidance on using MPS to understand and curb the rise of NCDs in LMICs and respond to challenges surrounding the employment of mobile phone technology in LMICs. Next steps include continuing to document empirical experiences of MPS used to collect NCD risk factor data, engaging with global bodies toward the development of a research agenda, establishing a global working group of experts to address the ethical issues surrounding MPS use in LMICs, and working with international and national level policy-makers to create a comparative framework for turning results into policy and practice.

The study was part of the Data for Health Initiative (D4H), funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies. CSDI brings together survey practitioners who work on projects across cultures and regions. Presenters shared best practices around questionnaire development, translation and comparability of data; all concepts pertinent to D4H‚Äôs MPS work. Abigail‚Äôs presentation was part of the ‚ÄúInnovative Uses of Technologies & Tools‚Äù session, and reviewed the interactive voice response (IVR) survey, a MPS method. The IVR survey uses pre-recorded questions in order to provide for remote data collection. D4H seeks to help government officials and public health leaders make informed decisions on health care priorities by collecting public health data. The Initiative seeks to improve civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems, explore ways to expand current non-communicable disease (NCD) surveillance efforts, and provide training on data analysis and use to governments in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). JHSPH is a partner organization that is leading the research and development (R&D) component of the NCD arm of the Initiative. NCDs can be prevented by the reduction of exposure to major risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and harmful use of alcohol. Researchers at JHSPH are evaluating the viability of mobile phone surveys to gather NCD risk factor information. With increasing mobile phone access in rural and hard-to-reach areas, mobile phone surveys (MPS) can be used to improve the efficiency, timeliness and cost-effectiveness of data collection in LMICs by interviewing respondents over their own personal mobile phone. There is currently a dearth of research about IVR practices in LMICs. In 2016, the JHSPH team piloted an NCD risk factor MPS in three countries in order to promote IVR survey best practices. In addition to Abigail, the team consisted of researchers from the Department of International Health: Drs. Dustin Gibson, Alain Labrique and George Pariyo, as well as Program Director, Dr. Adnan Hyder; and Mr. Joe Ali of JHU Berman Institute of Bioethics.

The new series, published in July 2017, is a comprehensive review that describes all of the findings that assess the effectiveness of CBPHC in defined geographic populations for maternal, neonatal and child health (MNCH). The comprehensive review is 10 years in the making and is comprised of 700 documents, going as far back as 1950. Community-based primary health care has been growing slowly in importance over the last 50 years, and while rigorous evidence of its effectiveness has increased substantially in recent years, international organizations have been slow to invest in capacity-building for successful CBPHC programs. The series summarizes the extensive evidence that demonstrates that MNCH can be improved through community-based approaches such as use of community health workers and volunteers, and¬†community engagement for planning, implementation and evaluation. One of the major findings from this comprehensive review focuses on the implications for the health-related sustainable development goals (SDGs). In order to fulfill the SDGs of universal health care coverage and ending preventable maternal, neonatal and child deaths by 2030, greater investments in community-based primary health care will be required. The majority of health care funding in low-income countries currently goes for services provided at health facilities. However, the evidence that investments in health facilities alone without investments in CBPHC will reduce mortality in geographically-defined populations is extremely limited. In resource-constrained settings, the mothers and children that do obtain care at health facilities tend to be those who are better-off and live closer to the facility. CBPHC fulfills the SDG equity indicators by expanding access to basic services in areas where facilities are often far away. One example of a successful, national, community-based health care program is in Ethiopia, where over the past 15 years marked improvements have been achieved through the deployment of 40,000 salaried community health workers with one year of formal training (health extension workers) and three¬†million volunteer community health workers (called the Health Development Army). Ethiopia has become a global leader in CBPHC and has recently established the International Institute for Primary Health Care in Ethiopia (IIfPHC-E), which will provide opportunities for training and research in primary health care with a focus on community-based approaches. Faculty at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, including Dr. Perry, are supporting Ethiopia‚Äôs Ministry of Health in this effort so that Ministries of Health in other countries can learn how to strengthen their own primary health care system. The journal series is publicly available online , (see Research Theme 5), and will also be published soon as a book that will be sold on Amazon. In addition to Dr. Perry, 150 other students, researchers and experts were involved in this project, including Department of International Health faculty Drs. Robert Black, Mary Carol Jennings, Meike Schleiff and Emma Sacks. Most of the students involved were from the Department of International Health. The Health Systems Program is focused on achieving accessible, cost-effective health care and healthy outcomes across the lifespan for families, communities and nations. In the past decade, the Program has conducted projects in over 50 countries, with particular expertise in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where the greatest number of people continue to struggle with deep poverty and unmet health needs.

Siddhisena, Emeritus Professor of Demography at the University of Colombo, came and spoke to Health Systems students on the topic of population aging in Sri Lanka. Population aging refers to the process of an increase in the proportion of elderly persons in a total population. Sri Lanka, whose aging demarcation age is considered to be 60, is experiencing one of the fastest aging populations in the developing world due to its speedy demographic transition. Sri Lanka will also be the most aged country in South Asia ‚Äì the proportion of elderly persons over 60 is almost double that of other countries in the same region. Elderly people tend to be in poorer health and in need of more medical services than younger populations. An increase in the percentage of elderly people results in a change in the volume of services needed, and health systems will need to adapt to manage an increase in chronic conditions from non-communicable diseases.

Dr. Sara Bennett , professor, Dr. Daniela Rodriguez , assistant scientist, Jess Wilhelm, PhD student, and Mary Qiu, senior research program coordinator, went to Kenya and Uganda to examine the health systems impact in regions of both countries that are transitioning their HIV/AIDS programs to government support as part of Phase III of the United States President‚Äôs Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)‚Äôs sustained control of the AIDS epidemic. Project SOAR is a five-year program funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and led by the Population Council that conducts HIV and AIDS operational research. The evaluation of the Geographic Pivot is a specific component of the project, led by Dr. Bennett. HIV/AIDS continues to be a significant burden on low- and middle-income countries, and funding for the epidemic has plateaued in recent years. PEPFAR‚Äôs geographic prioritization strategy focuses on intensifying support to regions where the HIV/AIDS burden is highest, and phasing support to the government in regions where the burden is less severe. The objective of this shift is to increase efficiency of available funds and to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goal of having 90% of all HIV+ individuals aware of their status, 90% all people diagnosed with HIV on sustained antiretroviral therapy, and 90% of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy to have viral suppression, by 2020. The Health Systems team is examining how the transition is being implemented and what the impact is on transitioned regions. Their research consists of a facility survey; document reviews from USAID and governments in Kenya and Uganda; and primary interviews with ministry of health employees, patients, and government officials in order to get a multi-perspective account of the impact of these changes. As part of their effort to understand how health systems are affected by the change in support allocation, they are deploying a large-scale survey across the transitioned regions and are training in-country partners to conduct the survey. In addition to the survey, the in-country teams are conducting in-depth interviews with specific health facilities in Kenya and Uganda to get a more thorough understanding of the transition effects across all levels of health care, from delivery to how it is affecting business operations, such as human resources and available commodities. The goal of the project is to help guide both donors and in-country government on how to implement programmatic transitions while limiting any adverse effects on how health systems function and care is delivered. Findings from the Program‚Äôs researchers will inform future efforts to manage HIV/AIDS investment and create a more targeted response to the epidemic.

It is well-known that many health disparities exist between men and women all over the world due to unequal access to basic health care and education. While certainly not specific to resource-poor settings, women tend to experience more discrimination and mistreatment in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where there are also higher rates of preventable deaths and disease. Because of societal structures and social pressures, women can have unequal power in sexual relationships, economic decision-making, and navigating reproductive and child health services 1 . One of the most effective ways we can reduce this inequity is by promoting, supporting and fostering the next generation of women leaders in low- and middle-income countries. Equity in leadership is desired in all fields, but it is especially important in the field of health and medicine where saving lives and reducing global health burdens is a core and urgent task. Women leaders are more likely to implement policies that target women and children, and are more likely to support antenatal care, health facilities and immunizations 2 . When it is quite literally a matter of life and death, I believe that it is critical to address the gender gap in health leadership, especially when there is strength in working collaboratively and added value in community-building and diversity. Lack of easily accessible female role models and difficulties balancing career and personal life contribute to the inequity in global health leadership 3 . Women are put under enormous pressure to maintain a balance between family life and professional life, a burden that is even heavier for women in LMICs where they are often expected to prioritize family over education. Women in resource-poor settings also face the added challenges of abiding by social-cultural norms often set my men, facing daily hurdles in mobility, and unfriendly work environments. In order to tackle some of the most pressing health issues, we need to encourage and support women‚Äôs leadership in health, especially in the most vulnerable parts of the world. It is crucial to do this work in a meaningful way by incorporating the views and lived experiences of those in the ‚Äòglobal south‚Äô into our policies and decision-making process, and by considering local priorities in ensuring equal access to education and resources. Gender equality is not just an issue for women but an issue for everyone and if we don‚Äôt strive to achieve it, we will continue to struggle with the burden of death, disease and disability worldwide.

He is now an adjunct assistant professor with the Health Systems Program , based in Bangladesh, where he is also serving as an assistant professor at BRAC James P Grant School of Public Health, BRAC University. Three of the articles based on his doctoral thesis have been published recently in Health Policy and Planning , BMC Health Services Research and PLoS ONE . Dr. Joarder discusses his work and the impact of his research in rural Bangladesh below: 1. What was the specific topic of your thesis while you were a student in the Health Systems Program? The overall goal of my thesis was to understand the elements of responsiveness of physicians in rural Bangladeshi context, to develop a reliable and valid scale to measure the responsiveness of physicians, and finally, to demonstrate the application of the scale. The title of my thesis was ‚ÄòUnderstanding and measuring the responsiveness of human resources for health in rural Bangladesh.‚Äô 2. What qualities define ideal responsiveness in physicians, and why is this important in the context of rural Bangladesh? In my study context, the responsiveness of physicians is defined in terms of five domains: friendliness, respecting, informing and guiding, gaining trust and financial sensitivity. As the name of the domains suggests, an ideally responsive rural Bangladeshi physician should communicate with the patients in a friendly manner; explicitly show respect to the patients; empower them by providing information and guidance; gain the trust of the patients, or refrain from doing something that may breach trust; and understand the financial need of the patients and provide support if needed, even if it requires going beyond the consultation. Responsiveness of physicians is important in general because it improves the trust of patients in the physicians. Lack of responsiveness may dissuade marginalized groups of patients, such as the elderly, chronic care patients, expectant and new mothers, and the LGBT community from care-seeking. Responsiveness of physicians is particularly important in the Bangladeshi context, as we have observed a massive rise of incidents of assaulting the physicians physically and vandalizing the health facilities by patients, alleging the physicians to be discourteous or unresponsive. As a response, the physicians also frequently hold strikes and refuse to provide care. These unexpected events eventually compromise the health and wellbeing of many innocent, helpless and mostly poor patients, often leading to their death. 3. What methods did you use to compare private vs. public sector responsiveness? I used both quantitative and qualitative methods: the qualitative part included in-depth interviews with public and private sector physicians and patients; focus group discussion with male and female patients; and observation in the consultation rooms of public and private sector physicians. The qualitative part was followed by the quantitative part, which included structured observation of actual consultations in 195 public sector settings and 198 private. 4. Your study found that each sector needed improvements in order to reach optimal performance. What can each sector do better to improve their respective areas of weakness? In the public sector, we found that physicians scored lower in friendliness, respecting, and informing and guiding domains. We also found that public sector physicians consulted a higher number of patients and spent less time per patient¬†compared to their private sector counterparts. So, in order to improve their performance, the policy-makers may consider restricting the number of patients a physician can consult per day. There should be a minimum average consultation length ma",4000,23321,"bloomberg school of public health, school of public health, johns hopkins, departments, academics, research, centers, admissions, preparedness, infectious diseases,Johns Hopkins University,Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,academic departments,Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Health Policy and Management,Biostatistics,International Health,Environmental Health Sciences,Mental Health,Epidemiology,Molecular Microbiology and Immunology,Health, Behavior & Society,Population,Family and Reproductive Health,Population and family health sciences, International health, global health, phd, doctorate, masters, master's, mhs, mph, global health academic programs, international health, Academic Programs, Department of International Health, GDEC, SBI, Health Systems, Human Nutrition, Social and Behavioral Interventions, Global Disease Epidemiology and Control, global health degree, global health PHD, global health master's",937,Health Systems Program,22,,0,,0,,0,,,,47013,1455,21.205286,14,9,0.77,147,134,25,23,b3ea9e03c4eebd4858af70416b927372,0.653,,,,https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/international-health/program-areas/health-systems/Health-Systems-Program/public-and-private-sector-physicians-in-rural-bangladesh-who-is-more-responsive

He is also thematic lead for the Transformative Technologies and Institutions arm of the recently launched Johns Hopkins Alliance for a Healthier World. Dr. So brings expertise in designing innovations that enable or improve access to novel health technologies, and leads initiatives that tackle the growing issue of antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an emerging health issue across the globe, as bacterial strains are becoming resistant to the antibacterial agents meant to protect against them. In November 2015, it was discovered that a new form of resistance had developed against colistin, an antibacterial agent and the last-line of defense for warding off potentially deadly drug-resistant infections. ¬† If left unchecked, it is projected that 10 million people will die from drug-resistant infections in 2050, more than the number of people who die from cancer today. Growing resistance to antibiotics will put at risk adequate care for treatments such as cancer chemotherapy, organ donor transplants, and the treatment of women and babies suffering from infections during childbirth. Treating infections presumptively as bacterial can sometimes cost less than giving the diagnostic test, thereby contributing to overuse. However, underuse of antibiotics, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, can take a greater toll than overuse today. Dr. So heads the North American and the Strategic Policy team of ReAct ‚ÄîAction on Antibiotic Resistance, an independent international network designed to create awareness of antibiotic resistance and advocate for global engagement in preventing this deadly phenomenon. The North American branch focuses on policy issues and supports the work of the Antibiotic Resistance Coalition (ARC) , a group of civil society organizations working in human, environmental and agricultural health advocating for global action on AMR. Both food production and healthcare delivery system use antimicrobials inappropriately. By volume, more antibiotics are used in raising livestock than in human medicine. ARC was, in part, created to bring civil society groups together to address AMR as an intersectoral challenge. Through the work of ReAct and ARC, Dr. So has led policy, research and advocacy efforts to shape the priorities on tackling antimicrobial resistance and influence global conversations around AMR. With partner groups, the ReAct Strategic Policy Program has produced a monthly newsletter for ARC; co-organized an AMR briefing in lead up to the UN Political Declaration on AMR; co-authored a briefing for member States and civil society on AMR issues for the WHO Executive Board discussions; co-organized a side event on AMR at the World Health Assembly; supported policy recommendations for the Tripartite Agencies (WHO, FAO and OIE) as well as the UN‚Äôs Interagency Coordination Group (IACG) on AMR; and recently undertook a commissioned analysis for WHO to lay out policy options for global antimicrobial stewardship. The ReAct Strategic Policy Program also co-organized a Civil Society Roundtable with the head of the WHO AMR Secretariat and the third annual, WHO-NGO Dialogue Report on AMR this past year. The program also helped to pull together a workshop on AMR for the Junior Doctor‚Äôs Network in lead up to the World Medical Association. The workshop timed with efforts within the World Medical Association to consider whether and how best to update its 2008 position on AMR in light of unfolding events. Working with colleagues at Hopkins, the ReAct Strategic Policy Program submitted a commissioned paper for the UK Review on AMR and has begun to analyze the economics and externalities of AMR under a JHU Discovery Award.

There are varying disciplines that attempt to examine why social and behavioral change can be so difficult to accomplish. One of those fields, Health Economics, examines how to design incentives to motivate people to take care of themselves. Dr. Antonio Trujillo, co-director of Health Systems Program‚Äôs Master of Health Science (MHS) in Health Economics academic program, spearheads a study in Peru that attempts to understand why people with diabetes fail to take care of themselves over and over again. In collaboration with the Center of Excellence in Chronic Diseases (CRONICAS) in Peru, Dr. Trujillo‚Äôs study looks at the role group incentives play in promoting healthier behavior, specifically, how we can use the combination of cooperation and group monetary rewards to encourage people with diabetes to take care of themselves. Past studies have examined the use of individual monetary incentives to accomplish certain outcomes when trying to change behavior; however, individual cash rewards have increasingly been found to work short-term but not in the long run. In addition to a lack of long-term success for consistent healthy behavior, they are often infeasible and unaffordable to scale-up to larger projects and studies, and frequently face rejection from the general public who are opposed to paying individuals to take care of themselves. This Health Systems Program project examines the viability of a mixed-incentive study that combines both group motivation and monetary reward. Using a teamwork approach, there are two participants: one patient implements the suggested lifestyle changes while their partner, designated as a ‚Äúmotivator,‚Äù encourages them to stick to the new regimen. If the person implementing the suggested changes makes the goal, then they both get rewarded. The aim of the design is to foster cooperation and synergies between participants. The use of social networks and personal connections establishes a more meaningful tie to the healthier routine. Challenges to introducing behavior change over the long haul still persist and a big part of Dr. Trujillo‚Äôs work is understanding these challenges and how best to mitigate them. One such challenge touches upon one of the basic fundamentals of public health - people in many areas of the world lack the information and knowledge, access to primary care and insurance, and do not have the income to support a steady upkeep of their health. These obstacles persist across all geographic areas, and failures to take care of diabetes are similar in both the U.S. and Peru. Dr. Trujillo and the Health Systems Program wish to see gains happen across all different types of behaviors, starting with designing better programs to address chronic disease; however, in order to achieve that, it‚Äôs necessary to help people develop a habit of taking care of themselves ‚Äì all around the world.¬†",3022,17553,"bloomberg school of public health, school of public health, johns hopkins, departments, academics, research, centers, admissions, preparedness, infectious diseases,Johns Hopkins University,Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,academic departments,Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Health Policy and Management,Biostatistics,International Health,Environmental Health Sciences,Mental Health,Epidemiology,Molecular Microbiology and Immunology,Health, Behavior & Society,Population,Family and Reproductive Health,Population and family health sciences, International health, global health, phd, doctorate, masters, master's, mhs, mph, global health academic programs, international health, Academic Programs, Department of International Health, GDEC, SBI, Health Systems, Human Nutrition, Social and Behavioral Interventions, Global Disease Epidemiology and Control, global health degree, global health PHD, global health master's, behavior change,chronic conditions,diabetes,health economics",999,Health Systems Program,22,,0,,0,,0,,,,40336,994,16.845318,10,9,0.77,150,134,22,20,86b2d2cf70422d3facf1959cbd79baa,0.719,,,,https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/international-health/program-areas/health-systems/Health-Systems-Program/the-economics-of-behavior-change-reducing-the-burden-of-chronic-conditions

The awards were given to Sudip Bhandari, Douglas Glandon, Jose Gutierrez and Ankita Meghani. Sudip won for his qualitative research project, which focused on evaluating the national and local context against which the contracting-out model has been implemented in Nepal, especially after the earthquakes in 2015. Contracting-out refers to the process in which essential public services, such as healthcare, are delivered through third party non-state actors. Contracting-out is common in post-conflict and fragile situations where institutional capacity for service provision might be compromised. While there are advantages to contracting-out, including facilitation of state-building, it is also vulnerable to fiduciary, political, and technical risks like bypassing of government and undermining long-term recovery. With his project, Sudip hopes to provide avenues for developing a framework and set of indicators in order to evaluate the effects of policy decisions on contracting-out in the Nepalese context. Douglas‚Äô research examines collaboration between frontline workers from the two Indian government ministries that have joint responsibility for delivering essential health and nutrition services to women and children in villages across the country. While the government has achieved widespread geographical coverage, multiple evaluations have highlighted substantial gaps in implementation and limited impact on child nutritional status and development outcomes. These shortfalls have prompted calls for strategic review of the initiative, including the approach to collaboration. Douglas‚Äô dissertation aims to develop a village-level collaboration scorecard, measure associations with service coverage, and identify key local governance factors affecting the nature and extent of collaboration between the frontline workers from these two ministries. Jose received the award for his proposed research on a comparative analysis of Guatemala and El Salvador‚Äôs post-conflict health reforms. In the aftermath of decades-long civil war, both countries sought to expand primary healthcare coverage among the poor, however, their contrasting strategies set them on divergent trajectories. By situating their experiences within their post-conflict political economies, Jose will explore questions such as how the structure of political institutions influences the degree of accountability to marginalized groups, how elite capture of fiscal policy reform constrains health system resources, and specifically in Guatemala, how health policies embody the social exclusion of the indigenous population. The study ultimately aims to generate lessons for policymakers and researchers seeking to make sense of the policy process and working towards Universal Health Coverage. Ankita‚Äôs research focuses on understanding the perspectives of policymakers and key stakeholders in Uganda on the integration of non-communicable disease (NCD) care into existing community health worker (CHW) roles. Given the rising burden of NCDs, Uganda has been looking at various mechanisms to scale up NCD prevention and treatment services to reach communities, and training CHWs to provide basic NCD services and manage care is one possible approach. Understanding policymakers‚Äô perspectives on this proposed policy could help identify contextual factors as well as barriers and opportunities that could influence the policy formulation and implementation for scaling up NCD services. Results from this research will aim to highlight areas that may need further examination, as the country moves towards expanding access to NCD care.

Johns Hopkins University is co-hosting the 2017 conference, along with Makerere University in Uganda. The Health Systems Program in the Department of International Health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health will have two plenary panel sessions held on Sunday, April 9: Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) with Dr. Adnan Hyder, and Humanitarian Emergencies with Dr. Paul Spiegel. Department Chair, Dr. David Peters, will also be a featured speaker in a pre-conference satellite session on Thursday, April 6, entitled Putting Quality on the Global Health Agenda . Register here . Deaths from NCDs are rising rapidly worldwide, especially in developing countries who often lack the necessary resources and experience to respond adequately to this growing burden. Many health systems in LMICs are already struggling with poverty and unmet health needs from infectious diseases; NCDs - such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease ‚Äì exacerbate an already fragile health system. In addition, addressing injury-related deaths often results in a challenge to convince governments that injuries are a health care issue. Dr. Hyder, Professor and Director of the Health Systems Program, will present ‚ÄúBeyond Epidemiology of Injuries,‚Äù and will address the public health threat that deaths from injuries pose in LMICs. He will also discuss evidence-based strategies used to effect policy change and prevent injury-related deaths. Participants will be invited to share their experiences and suggestions on responding to the growing challenge of NCDs and deaths from injuries. At the end of the session, participants will be able to understand the emerging epidemic of NCDs in LMICs, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa; understand the value of and how to utilize established infectious disease care platforms for NCD care and prevention; and understand successful approaches and challenges to curbing injuries. The session will be held from 10:15 a.m. ‚Äì 11:45 a.m. Later that afternoon, Dr. Paul Spiegel will moderate a panel session on humanitarian emergencies. Dr. Spiegel is Director of the Center for Humanitarian Health , hosted by the Health Systems Program and Department of International Health. The session, held from 2:30 p.m. ‚Äì 4 p.m., will address the current global challenge of humanitarian emergencies and displacement of millions, and discuss ways to adapt health care responses for the future. The CUGH conference is held from April 7 ‚Äì 9, 2017 in Washington, DC.

The Institute, directed by Health Systems senior scientist, Dr. George Pariyo , is designed to provide students an entire academic term‚Äôs worth of instruction in a condensed period of time.¬† During the Summer Institute, participants have the opportunity to learn a variety of health systems skills and concepts that will help them measure the burden of disease and monitor and evaluate global health programs. Courses covered areas such as primary health care, gender analysis, technology innovation for global health, hospital and trauma surveillance, and summary measures of population health. This year, the Institute increased the number of course offerings from seven to 11 in order to accommodate for the growing number of program areas. New courses included Introduction to Gender Analysis within Health Systems Research , Monitoring and Evaluation of Health Systems Strengthening , Designing Transformative Innovation for Global Health , and Managing District Health Systems . The majority of health systems courses focus on low- and middle-income countries, but the skills are universal. The number of international students attending the Institute increased this year: as the Program amplifies its presence around the world, we hope to build a strong base of global students who can apply the principles of health systems in their home country. One such student, Khin Pa Pa Naing from the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Laos, chose to attend the Institute so she could gain skills and knowledge from the Monitoring and Evaluation course for her daily routine working with the MoH. ¬†¬† ‚Äú It provided very in-depth thinking about the current situation of resource limitation, availability and allocation for the public health sector and medical care in developing countries, and how we as public health professionals could improve this situation ,‚Äù stated Khin Pa Pa. In addition to Ms. Naing, we welcomed students from Canada, Nigeria, South Africa, Japan, Kenya, Vietnam, Thailand and Bangladesh. ¬† The Institute is also working to foster the growing number of part-time MPH students coming from all regions of the country, seeking to fulfill their 20% requirement of attending on-campus courses. We provided four lunchtime networking sessions, and hope to continue to expand our social offerings next year. ¬† As we seek to enhance the Health Systems Summer Institute in future years to incorporate more students coming from all areas of the public health sector, we will continue to expand and diversify our course offerings.

Youngji Jo, Mariana Socal and Veena Sriram presented their research from Bangladesh, Brazil and India. Youngji‚Äôs dissertation, Cost-Effectiveness and Scalability of an mHealth Intervention to Improve Pregnancy Surveillance and Care Seeking in Rural Bangladesh , focused on how digital health can be used to improve maternal and newborn health. Proven health interventions could save millions of lives, but coverage of these interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is low. Mobile health (mHealth) has shown a potential impact for improving knowledge, service delivery and intended health outcomes, but little evidence exists on its value for money or affordability in developing countries. Youngji examined the mCARE program in rural Bangladesh, which was designed to increase service utilization during pregnancy using SMS and home visit reminders to pregnant women from an established group of community workers. Her research found that the program, implemented from 2011 ‚Äì 2015, was highly cost-effective and had¬†a marginal budget impact in the country, based on her forecasting model scenarios. With her research, Youngji hopes to guide policy and program decision-making in Bangladesh and provide evidence for globally investing in healthcare innovations. Mariana's dissertation, Polypharmacy in Older Adults: A Multi-Level Analysis of Trends and Determinants in Sao Paulo, Brazil , examined the occurrence of polypharmacy, an emerging public health problem where individuals utilize too many prescription drugs. Mariana found that a large proportion of older adults in Sao Paulo are exposed to polypharmacy, and that most of them are at an increased risk of adverse effects from the drugs they are taking. Through an examination of the health systems factors associated with polypharmacy, Mariana found that lower availability of doctors in the public health system and higher presence of private pharmacies and hospitals in a geographic area were associated with a higher likelihood of polypharmacy among persons living in that area, regardless of health conditions and socio-demographic characteristics. With her findings, Mariana hopes to bring to light that polypharmacy among older adults should be a public health concern in Sao Paulo, and that increasing the number of doctors in the public health system and focusing on integrating healthcare could potentially be policy options used to mitigate polypharmacy in the Sao Paulo context. ¬† Veena‚Äôs dissertation, The Evolution of Emergency Medicine as a Medical Specialty in India: A Policy Analysis , examined the power dynamics in play in the specialization of medical services in LMICs, using emergency medicine in India as a case study. Her research centered on the dual concepts of equitable access to health care and how medical specialties are regulated in India. Developed in response to a lack of emphasis in health systems research on governance and regulation, her study examined how new medical specialties emerge in India and how regulatory institutions within a country decide whether to include a specialty or not. Veena aimed to interrogate the idea of ‚Äòspecialization‚Äô as a solution to service delivery problems, such as weak emergency care, and understand how stakeholders perceive the impact of specialization on health systems and equitable access to care. The role of power is not well understood in health systems research, and with her work, Veena hopes to contribute to the knowledge gap around this topic.

Mansoor Shams, a Johns Hopkins Alumnus and U.S. Marine Corps Veteran, aims to interrogate the stigma that continues to perpetuate, a challenge growing slightly more tricky given the President‚Äôs recent Executive Order. Mansoor served four years in the marines, from 2000 to 2004, an honor he wears with pride. In that time, he attained the rank of corporal and received several honors, including meritorious promotion, Marine of the Quarter, and Certificate of Commendation. Mansoor is also a small-business owner, serving as the President of Technology for Eye Deal Systems, a distributor of technology and consumer products and provider of information technology solutions. A self-appointed ambassador as the ‚ÄúMuslim Marine,‚Äù Mansoor‚Äôs method of choice for combatting Islamophobia is through one-on-one dialogue with other Americans. Recently, he has been travelling around the country with the goal of reminding the American public that it was our willingness as a culture to welcome people of all religions, culture and ethnicity that makes us an example to the rest of the world. People questioning his loyalty to the country was an attitude that Mansoor didn‚Äôt consider when he joined the U.S. military- after all, loyalty to one‚Äôs country is part of the Islamic faith. He strives to educate on common questions people have about his Muslim faith, women‚Äôs rights and terrorism, and reminds people that the Muslim world is comprised of 1.6 billion-plus people. It is important to make a conscious effort not to paint everyone with a broad brush. At a time where anti-Muslim rhetoric from political leaders is growing increasingly common and anti-Muslim hate crimes are at their highest since 9/11, it is important to have as many conversations with people as possible. On February 15, Mansoor Shams is speaking at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH) in the first of a series of seminars on understanding American Muslims, a series that hope to highlight the many positive contributions of Muslims across the country. The seminar series is going to be part of a larger initiative exploring the life, successes and challenges of American Muslims.¬†",2312,13407,"bloomberg school of public health, school of public health, johns hopkins, departments, academics, research, centers, admissions, preparedness, infectious diseases,Johns Hopkins University,Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,academic departments,Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Health Policy and Management,Biostatistics,International Health,Environmental Health Sciences,Mental Health,Epidemiology,Molecular Microbiology and Immunology,Health, Behavior & Society,Population,Family and Reproductive Health,Population and family health sciences, International health, global health, phd, doctorate, masters, master's, mhs, mph, global health academic programs, international health, Academic Programs, Department of International Health, GDEC, SBI, Health Systems, Human Nutrition, Social and Behavioral Interventions, Global Disease Epidemiology and Control, global health degree, global health PHD, global health master's",937,Health Systems Program,22,,0,,0,,0,,,,38536,864,15.373227,5,4,0.34,148,135,23,21,79b075facf0097e959dfa0c64a34f5b9,0.572,,,,https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/international-health/program-areas/health-systems/Health-Systems-Program/understanding-american-muslims

Our Program‚Äôs goal is to enhance the capacity of communities to improve the health of their people, and we hope to share stories from around the world about our efforts. Our multidisciplinary faculty work in partnership with local governments, community leaders, ministries of health, community-based health and human service agencies, universities and research institutes to address health burdens that span a wide range of fields. From humanitarian relief, to mobile health technology, to addressing the burden of chronic conditions, to injury prevention, our intent is to promote sustainable and community-driven health care and health system interventions. In light of many global changes, such as the transition from Millennium Development Goals to Sustainable Development Goals and the impending threat of global warming, we hope to join a very important conversation on the future of health systems and define what a cost-effective, equitable and resilient health system should look like. We will do this online, at conferences, and in person as we travel the globe. I am excited about several items our Program has slated for this year: we launched our Facebook and Twitter accounts so that we can share with you and also hear what you have to say; we have released our first Annual Report for 2015; and most importantly, we welcomed our new Health Systems students into our MSPH, PhD and MHS in Health Economics degree programs.
